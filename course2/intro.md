## Take homework sample

Try to run in on a windows pc.


### Several problems:

* There is no .sln file
* Unknown includes
* Unknown function calls



## Cross platform programming

**1 frontend, multiple backends**

_The user should not write platform specific code_


### Solution 1: Virtuality

* Graphics platform
* Sound system

**Exercise:**
Write a simple program that accepts the following syntax:
`myprogram --backend="xx_renderer"`
You support a green console renderer and a red console renderer.
The program's output should be:
`Look mom! I'm colored text!`

Implement those backends using virtuality.
