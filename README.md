## Run the slides locally

This requires you to setup a local webserver in the root of the project.
Also make sure that git does not change the line endings. The markdown files contain 2/3 new lines to seperate slides. If this changes, the slides are broken.

to clone this repo use:
    `git clone https://github.com/NuclearCookie/PlatformDevSlides.git --recursive --origin upstream`
